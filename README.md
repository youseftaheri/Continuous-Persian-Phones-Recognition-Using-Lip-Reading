# Continuous-Persian-Phones-Recognition-Using-Lip-Reading

Abstract— The main preference in this paper by comparison with
other researches is given to application of several specifications
together in effect to gait toward creating a suitable system for
dumb and deaf usage. In other words, in this paper, we try to
recognize continuous phones in different words, uttered by
different males and females, with different uttering speed,
without using hand-labeled model on lips and without wasting
time on processing unnecessary pixels. In addition, we use our
best effort to have the most usage of pixel colours. Although most
of these specifications cause confusions in recognition, we believe
that considering these specifications together in researches,
results in creating a real time automatic lip reading system in less
time in future. The result of testing 12 different utterances were
66.1% for phones period detection and 51.3% for phones
recognition.
